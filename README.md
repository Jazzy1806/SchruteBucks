## Overview

The application allows users across a company to have a social experience aimed at increasing morale and strengthening networking between employees. This is accomplished by including a few different features that allow users to interact in a way that rewards them by the amount of points they earn. Points can be earned by joining company events, being awarded from other employees in the shape of: major project accomplishments, being a good teammate and more. These points can be exchanged for different tier reward items. Finally, included is a live chat feature that allows users to talk to each other. Administrative controls are maintained and only those users given permission are allowed to approve pending requests, which include; award submission, prize suggestions, event locations, updating employees and more. The website is backed my mySQL and maintains the data used for all the actions available to the users. All CRUD actions are included which the DELETE function primarily being "in-active".

## Lessons Learned
This has been a great experience working as a team. We were introduced to branching for this project and used it minimally through the use of open communication and a lot of talking. This time, we approached breaking up the different parts by having multiple controllers, DAO's, folders and files in order to further prevent merge issues. This project introduced us to JPA and JPQL in a more useful approach of finding relationships between different entities. While every project has their own challenges, we decided to go even further by looking into adding a live chat feature, which required a lot of work and understanding languages we are not familiar with but in doing so, our level of knowledge increased 10 fold.
