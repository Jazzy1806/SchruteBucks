      <h2>Welcome to Reward For Pay</h2><br>
      <h4>Here at Reward For Pay we connect employees and their company together by providing a open space to reward each other. We understand that working just for pay isn't enough and having the incentive of a prize behind it can really motivate employees.</h4><br>
      <p>Cash incentives and nonmonetary incentives alike can promote motivation, which can significantly increase productivity and, potentially, profits. The top three incentives are cash, gifts and experiences. Some examples of gifts are electronics, ride-share credit and gift cards. Experiences include perks like tickets to concerts, festivals and sporting events.</p>
